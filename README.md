# NodomGenerator

This Little (Dirty Code :p ) Script helps me to generate basic PHP components like :
  
  - A SQL file which contains the table structure of my component (e.g : t_company);
  - Component Model, this file contains the Class Model attributes, setters and getters (it's like a JavaBean for Java folks ! );
  - Component Model Manager, it handles with the database and it's responsible for CRUD operations;
  - Component Action Controller, it's responsible on making forms and other action elements works.

At this moment these are the basic component of this Script, in the futur (i hope this comes up soon),
i will add routing and views.

If you have any suggestion, critics feel free to contact me on aassou.abdelilah@gmail.com
And also feel free to use it if you like it (well, i know it's not that pretty cool :p)
